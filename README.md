## Overview

`ostis-example-app` is a working example of an ostis-system, utilizing the [OSTIS Technology](https://github.com/ostis-ai). It serves as a practical starting point for developers who want to build intelligent systems with the OSTIS Technology. Adapt and extend this example to meet your specific needs.

This application demonstrates the key components of an ostis-system:

*   **Knowledge Base:** Stores facts, rules, and relationships using SC-code (`.scs` and `.gwf` files).
*   **Problem Solver:** C++ agents that implement the system's logic, interacting with the knowledge base to perform tasks.
*   **Interface:** A web UI for user interaction, allowing queries, knowledge visualization, and action triggering.

## Getting Started

Choose between Docker (recommended) or Native installation.

### Prerequisites

Ensure these tools are installed before proceeding:

#### General Prerequisites

Required for both Docker and Native installations:

*   **Git:**  For cloning the repository.
    [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Docker Setup (Recommended)

Docker simplifies setup and provides a consistent environment.

1.  **Install Docker and Docker Compose:**

    Instructions: [https://www.docker.com/get-started/](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).

2.  **Clone repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ostis-apps/ostis-example-app.git
    cd ostis-example-app
    git checkout 0.10.0
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

3.  **Build Docker images:**

    ```sh
    docker compose build
    ```

    This command creates the necessary Docker images for the application.

4.  **Build knowledge base:**

    ```sh
    docker compose run --rm machine build
    ```

    The `--rm` flag ensures the container is removed after the build.

5.  **Start ostis-system:**

    ```sh
    docker compose up
    ```
    
    This command starts all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file (sc-machine, sc-web). The system is accessible at `localhost:8000`.

6.  **Stop ostis-system:**

    ```sh
    docker compose stop
    ```

    This command stops and removes the containers created by `docker compose up`. To fully remove the containers, you can use `docker compose down` instead.

    *Important: Rebuild the knowledge base (step 4) after any changes to the knowledge base files.*

## Native Installation

Steps for installing and running the application directly on your system.

1.  **Install basic tools for development environment:**

    *   **Ubuntu/Debian (GCC):** 
        
        ```sh
        sudo apt update
        
        sudo apt install --yes --no-install-recommends \
            curl \
            ccache \
            python3 \
            python3-pip \
            build-essential \
            ninja-build
        ```
        
    *   **macOS (Clang):**

        ```sh
        brew update && brew upgrade
        brew install \
            curl \
            ccache \
            cmake \
            ninja
        ```

    *   **Other Linux distributions:**

        If you're using a different Linux distribution that doesn't support apt, ensure you have equivalent packages installed:

        * curl: A tool for transferring data with URLs;
        * ccache: A compiler cache to speed up compilation processes;
        * python3 and python3-pip: Python 3 interpreter and package installer;
        * build-essential: Includes a C++ compiler, necessary for building C++ components;
        * ninja-build: An alternative build system designed to be faster than traditional ones.

    Compiler is required for building C++ components.

2.  **Install pipx:**

    Instructions: [https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/).
    
    `pipx` isolates Python packages, preventing conflicts, especially useful when working with tools like CMake and Conan.

3.  **Install CMake:**

    ```sh
    pipx install cmake
    pipx ensurepath
    ```
   
    CMake is used to generate build files for your specific system. `pipx ensurepath` adds CMake to your PATH.

4.  **Install Conan:**

    ```sh
    pipx install conan
    pipx ensurepath
    ```
    
    Conan manages the project's C++ dependencies. `pipx ensurepath` adds Conan to your PATH.

5.  **Clone repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ostis-apps/ostis-example-app.git
    cd ostis-example-app
    git checkout 0.10.0
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

6.  **Restart your shell:**

    ```sh
    exec $SHELL
    ```
    
    Ensures that the PATH changes from `pipx ensurepath` are applied.

7.  **Install C++ problem solver dependencies:**

    They include sc-machine libraries -- the core components of the OSTIS Platform, used to develop C++ agents. They're installed using Conan:

    ```sh
    conan remote add ostis-ai https://conan.ostis.net/artifactory/api/conan/ostis-ai-library
    conan profile detect
    conan install . --build=missing
    ```
    
    `--build=missing` builds dependencies from source if pre-built binaries are not available.

8.  **Install sc-machine and scl-machine binaries:**
   
    sc-machine binaries are pre-compiled executables that provide the runtime environment for the ostis-system: build knowledge base source and launch the ostis-system. The installation process differs slightly between Linux and macOS:

    scl-machine binaries are pre-compiled modules with agents of logical inferences.
    
    ```sh
    ./scripts/install_cxx_problem_solver.sh
    ```
    
    Downloads and extracts pre-built `sc-machine` binaries for your operating system. The `include` directory is removed because it is not required.

9.  **Install sc-web:**

    sc-web provides the web-based user interface for the ostis-system. The installation process includes setting up dependencies and building the interface:

    *   **Ubuntu/Debian:**

        ```sh
        cd interface/sc-web
        ./scripts/install_deps_ubuntu.sh
        npm install  # Ensure npm dependencies are installed
        npm run build
        cd ../..
        ```

    *   **macOS:**

        ```sh
        cd interface/sc-web
        ./scripts/install_deps_macOS.sh
        npm install  # Ensure npm dependencies are installed
        npm run build
        cd ../..
        ```
    
    Installs the necessary dependencies for the web interface. `npm install` downloads JavaScript packages, and `npm run build` compiles the web interface.

## Building ostis-system

1.  **Build problem solver:**
   
    The problem solver contains custom agents for your ostis-system. Build it using CMake:

    ```sh
    cmake --preset release-conan
    cmake --build --preset release
    ```
    
    These commands use CMake to build the C++ problem solver in Release mode. The `--preset` option specifies a pre-configured build setup.

2.  **Build knowledge base:**

    The knowledge base contains your custom knowledge represented in SC-code. It needs to be built before launching the system or after making changes:

    ```sh
    ./scripts/start.sh build_kb
    ```
    
    This command builds the knowledge base from the `.scs` and `.gwf` files in the `knowledge-base` directory, creating the `kb.bin` directory.

## Running ostis-system

1.  **Start `sc-machine` (in a terminal):**

    ```sh
    ./scripts/start.sh machine
    ```
    
    Starts the `sc-machine`, loading the knowledge base (`kb.bin`) and specifying the paths to the extensions.

2.  **Start `sc-web` interface (in a separate terminal):**

    ```sh
    ./scripts/start.sh web
    ```
    
    Starts the web server.

3.  **Access interface:** Open `localhost:8000` in your web browser.

    ![Example Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/6SehI5s.png)

To stop the running servers for the ostis-example-app, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminals where sc-machine and sc-web are running.

## Documentation

To generate local documentation:

```sh
pip3 install mkdocs mkdocs-material markdown-include
mkdocs serve
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8005/` in your browser.

*Note: The documentation is currently under development and may be incomplete.*

## Project Structure

*   **`knowledge-base`**: Contains the knowledge base source files (`.scs`, `.gwf`). Rebuild the knowledge base after making changes:

    ```sh
    ./scripts/start.sh build_kb
    ```

*   **`problem-solver`**: Contains the C++ agents that implement the problem-solving logic. Rebuild after modifying:

    ```sh
    cmake --preset release-conan
    cmake --build --preset release
    ```

    For debug mode:

    ```sh
    conan install . --build=missing -s build_type=Debug
    cmake --preset debug-conan
    cmake --build --preset debug
    ```

    For release mode with tests:

    ```sh
    cmake --preset release-with-tests-conan
    cmake --build --preset release
    ```

    To update log type and log level of agent, modify constructor of agent class. By default, logs of agents execution are stored in the `logs` directory:

    ```plain
    logs/
    |--ExampleInferenceAgent.log
    |--IsomorphicSearchAgent.log
    |--PathSearchAgent.log
    |--SubdividingSearchAgent.log
    ```
